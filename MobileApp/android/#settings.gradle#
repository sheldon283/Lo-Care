Usage
Since this library was meant to be a drop-in replacement for the RN's Geolocation API, the usage is pretty straight forward, with some extra error cases to handle.

One thing to note, this library assumes that location permission is already granted by the user, so you have to use PermissionsAndroid to request for permission before making the location request.

...
import Geolocation from 'react-native-geolocation-service';
...
 
componentDidMount() {
    // Instead of navigator.geolocation, just use Geolocation.
    if (hasLocationPermission) {
        Geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
            (position) => {
                console.log(position);
            },
            (error) => {
                // See error code charts below.
                console.log(error.code, error.message);
            },
            { enableHighAccuracy: true, timeout: 15000, maximumAge: 10000 }
        );
    }
}

Turn phone off/on
Turn GPS off/on
Disable any battery saver settings, including Power Saving Mode, Battery Management or any third party apps
Perform an "AGPS reset": Install the App GPS Status & Toolbox, then in that app, go to Menu > Tools > Manage A-GPS State > Reset
Adjusting battery saver settings on different devices:

HTC: Access your phone settings > battery > power saving mode > battery optimization > select your app > don't optimize > save
Huawei: Turn Energy Settings to Normal and add your app to "Protected Apps"
LG If you're running Android 6 or higher: Settings > battery & power saving > battery usage > ignore optimizations > turn ON for your app
Motorola If you're running Android 6 or higher: Battery > select the menu in the upper right-hand corner > battery optimization > not optimized > all apps > select your app > don't optimize
OnePlus (using OxygenOS Settings): Battery > battery optimization > switch to 'all apps' > select your app > don't optimize
Samsung: Access battery settings > app power saving > details > your app > disabled
Sony If you're running Android 6 or higher: Battery > from the menu in the upper right-hand corner > battery optimization > apps > your app
Xiomi (MIUI OS) If you're running Android 6 or higher: Access your phone settings > additional settings > battery and performance > manage battery usage > apps > your app
